# System Setup Utility

This is a little program/script for setting up an Ubuntu machine with everything it needs to run

* Ruby
* Ruby on rails
* Python
* csvkit
* om my zsh
* janus

Optionally, you can also have it set up the following things for you.

## Bio suite

* BEAST (and related softwares)
* tracer
* figtree
* aptx

## dotfiles

All of the, ahem, BEST system configurations for these things above


## Ideas/TODO

* Auto press 'q' when the message for rvm installation pops up
* Have script ask before hand whether specific stuff should be installed (like biosuite)
