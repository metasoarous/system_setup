# System Setup Utility

This is a little SCons program/script + goodies for buiding out and syncing my system configurations.
My hope is to make it very flexible in what it builds out and what it doesn't (think topical build sets; combio, programming, etc..).
Right now though, it pretty rigidly assumes you are using Ubuntu (aptitude for installing packages).

So far, the folling has been set up or is planned:

* Ruby (via rvm)
* Python
* csvkit
* bio stuff (beast, tracer, figtree, aptx)
* vim/pathogen setup
* dotfiles (may change soon...)
* leinengen (coming soon...)

## Questions

* Run sudo commands together so there isn't any need to re-enter password?
* Better way of tracking what needs to be built; touch seems to loose, date to strict...
* Is it possible to automate figuring out which packages might conflict and dropping those out?
* config settings for different machines? Like different lock behaviour for laptop vs desktop


## TODO

* Make pathogen installs smarter; shouldn't have to rerun everything unless needed; will have to test
* Build custom cleaners for things that we don't want to loose the file (http://www.scons.org/wiki/CustomCleanActions)
* Get CrashPlan set up, maybe with automated data importing
* capts -> control, as seen [here](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MovingTheCtrlKey)
* maybe pass name and github stuff through command line in dotfiles
* lein profiles
* Alias sets
  * For sync frequency
  * Topical (especially apt-gets) so users can cherry pick

## Backup things

make sure to ignore ~/.local/share/Trash
* .zshhistory, .ssh
* autojump learning
  /home/csmall/.local/share/autojump
* grease monkey
  /home/csmall/.mozilla/firefox/ymqa6h42.default/gm_scripts
* firefox tabs -
